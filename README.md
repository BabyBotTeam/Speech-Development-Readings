# Speech-Development-Readings
The code for the speech development readings of Baby Bot

Baby Bot uses Edge Impulse, a platform that allows our device to acquire its speech detection capabilities. Once we inputted a variety of data and increased the 
accuracy of detection, we made our project public. The code you will be using comes from our Edge Impulse model: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/217046/latest
You will need to copy this code and keep it in ArduinoIDE after you have finished deploying the code to ArduinoIDE with the use of our model.

# Speech-Development-Readings
The code for the speech development readings of Baby Bot

Baby Bot uses Edge Impulse, a platform that allows our device to acquire its speech detection capabilities. Once we inputted a variety of data and increased the 
accuracy of detection, we made our project public. The code you will be using comes from our Edge Impulse model: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/217046/latest
We have also added more code manually to give the circuit Bluetooth capabilities, allowing the results to be displayed in LightBlue. You will need to copy this code and keep it in ArduinoIDE after you have finished deploying the code with the use of our model.
